## Introduction
This code base is an implementation of the supervised ML problem to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. 

## Running the code
The file [data_loader](#data_loader.py) is designed as a generic class to load and prepare data for feeding into ML Python modules. 

The notebooks [MNIST_ML_analysis_and_knn](#MNIST_ML_analysis_and_knn.ipynb) and [MNIST_Neural_Network](#MNIST_Neural_Network.ipynb) are IPython notebooks that can be run separately. 

Eventually there will be another Python file that wrap the ML functions in the notebooks.

## Future Steps
* New file which wraps functions from Python notebooks & compares results
* Implementation of autencoder
* Additional functionality of BaseDataLoader class with possibility of creating a fork
